# Regolith Co. Common Module

This is all the public common helper code that Regolith uses. Now that this is a public repo I really shuld have a better readme


## This module builds twice.

The back-end of Regolith is still CommonJS but the front end uses Vite and needs to be built with ESM.



....more docs coming soon.
